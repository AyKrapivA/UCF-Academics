The structural design tool called finite-elements analysis is
useful, even essential, for achieving optimum results with the
new composite materials (carbon, Kevlar). Of course, the method
can also be used for work with metals (steel, aluminum,
titanium). Leisha Peterson and Kelly Londry of Pegasus Research,
whose finite-elements analysis played a part in developing the
Trek 2000 frame, outline the method's application in bicycle
frame design.</p>

<h2>Finite-Element Structural Analysis: A New
Tool for Bicycle Frame Design </h2>

<h3>The Strain Energy Design Method</h3>

<h4>Leisha A. Peterson and Kelly J. Londry</h4>

<p>Intuition and trial-and-error have played
major roles in the evolution of today's diamond-shaped steel
frames. The design and manufacture of bicycle frames has largely
been an art, performed by skilled craftsmen; their efforts have
resulted in reliable, efficient structures.</p>

<p>The limitations of trial-and-error become
most apparent when new materials enter the picture, and when new
applications and demands are placed on the structure. Now that
bicycle framebuilders are using materials such as aluminum,
magnesium, titanium, and fiber composites, a need exists to help
the designer exploit the desirable properties of these materials.
Trial and error is costly and slow, and intuition does not always
yield reliable results. A promising solution is to turn to a
proven tool of structural engineering: the finite-element
analysis (FEA) method. The essence of FEA is to break a large
stress analysis problem into many smaller ones, which are then
collectively solved by computer. (A thorough treatment of FEA
applications in the auto industry is given in Modern Automotive
Structural Analysis, edited by M.M. Kamal and J.A. Wolf, Jr., New
York, NY, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, 1982, 460pp.) </p>

    <h4 align="center">Figure 1: The Trek 2000
    aluminum frame. The design was fine-tuned with aid of
    finite-element analysis, by comparing it against the Trek 770
    steel frame and the Vitus 979 aluminum frame (manufactured by
    Bador).</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>The method has helped the U.S. auto
manufacturers to stage their recent comeback, and it plays a
major role in the design of almost all new airplanes, ships,
bridges, and tall buildings built today. The bike industry is
just beginning to realize the potential value of FEA for improved
product design and a faster development cycle. And now that
standard office microcomputers (IBM-PC variety) can handle the
calculations for significantly large, complex models, more and
more manufacturers and designers will start to use the method.</p>

<p>Finite-element analysis is usually used to
fine-tune the geometry of a design that is still on the drawing
board, before working models are built and tested. FEA is also
used to debug an existing prototype. The first approach is more
cost-effective and can open the door to more creative solutions
at an early stage in the design process.</p>

<p>The design of the Trek 2000 aluminum frame
offers a good example of how FEA works in practice. Here, the
analysis was used to modify the design after Trek had built an
early prototype. The frame material itself (high-tensile
aluminum) and the joining method (adhesive bonding) were both
relatively new to the bicycle industry, and Trek realized that
necessary refinements would have been unacceptably slow and/or
expensive if the traditional trial-and-error paths were followed
blindly. </p>

<p>Our job, as consultants to Trek, was to
improve the early prototype, using finite element analysis, with
the goal of refining a frame design which performed at least as
well as top-class steel frames of conventional design. The
trial-and-error procedure was thus performed on the computer
rather than on the shop floor, saving valuable development time. </p>

<h3>Goals of the Study </h3>

<p>Our overall approach to the project was to
use the FEA tool to explore a wide range of trade-offs in frame
design, and then to narrow the focus to a few options which would
be most feasible for Trek to implement. This is the usual FEA
approach in automotive and aircraft design work. A byproduct of
this approach is that it lays the groundwork for future
developments; Trek is now in a position to explore more radical
designs and construction methods using FEA, with good assurance
that reliable results will be obtained. The objectives of each
stage of the work were as follows<strong>:</strong></p>

<p>1) Construct a complete finite-elements
model for the new frame design, as well as for two popular high
performance frames: a Trek 770 (Reynolds 531C steel) and a Vitus
979 aluminum frame (manufactured by Bador of France), all of
equal size (60 cm). The Trek 770 and the Bador frames are the
"base cases" against which the new design was compared.
</p>

<p>2) Apply a variety of loading conditions to
all frames to calculate their response characteristics. </p>

<p>3) Identify which loading conditions are
critical in the design, in terms of undesirable responses (high
stresses, high deflections, etc.). Establish which loads may be
safely ignored.</p>

<p>4) Look for relationships between strength,
stiffness, and weight by studying (graphing, plotting, etc.) the
output data from the previous steps. Seek intuitive insights from
the data about each frame's structural character.</p>

<p>5) Recommend future designs, and apply the
various critical load cases to gauge their performance.</p>

<p>Most of these objectives were met to a
reasonable extent. Following is a more detailed account of how
the FEA method works in practice. </p>

<h3>Building the Model</h3>

<p>The FEA modeling process requires three
types of input data: geometry, material properties, and loading.
For the bicycle frame, "geometry" means the overall
frame dimensions (such as tube lengths, intersection points, and
angles) as well as the tubing specifications (diameters, wall
thickness, tapers, ovals, etc.).</p>

<p>Using the geometry data, a
"pre-processor'' program subdivides the frame into a large
number of small pieces (the so-called "finite
elements") which accurately represent the various frame
components (see Figure 2).</p>

<h4 align="center"><img src="./Finite Element Structural Analysis  A New Tool for Bicycle Frame Design, by Leisha A. Peterson and Kelly J. Londry_files/fea2.gif" width="485" height="405"></h4>

<blockquote>
    <h4 align="center">Figure 2: The
    finite-elements model is built by subdividing the frame into
    about 100 discrete beam elements. Boundary conditions are
    represented by restraints at rear axle and head tube. </h4>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, individual elements are
assigned to represent such details as lugs, double-butting, and
tapered tubing. For each element, mechanical properties such as
cross-section area and principal moments of inertia are
calculated by the pre-processor.</p>

<p>The models described here are all
"beam models;" that is, each element in the model is
what's called a three-dimensional Euler-Bernoulli beam. Thus,
these elements can represent torsion, bending about two axes, and
both axial and shearing deformations. </p>

<p>The more elements that are used in building
the model, the better the resolution of localized
stress/deformation patterns. But there is a trade-off here;
calculations take much longer to complete as the number of
elements increases. The beam models in this project used about
100 elements each. </p>

<p>The material properties needed for setting
up the model include elastic modulus, shear modulus, Poisson
ratio, and mass density. (Figure 3 lists material data pertinent
to the Trek and Bador frames.) </p>

<h4 align="center">Figure 3: Material
Properties for Finite Elements Modeling.</h4>

<p>Strength-related properties (such as yield
strength and elongation-at-break) are primarily used only after
FEA, for evaluating the significance of internal stresses and
identifying critical loads.</p>

<h3>Loading</h3>

<p>Finally, the externally acting loads must
be specified in terms of magnitude, direction, and point of
application on the frame. Loading information is derived from
experiment, analytical deduction, and government standards. This
information is then used to specify forces and moments acting at
endpoints (nodes) of key elements such as dropouts, bottom
bracket bearing, head tube, seat post, and brake bridges. (See
figure 4.)</p>

<h4 align="center"><img src="./Finite Element Structural Analysis  A New Tool for Bicycle Frame Design, by Leisha A. Peterson and Kelly J. Londry_files/fea4.gif" width="484" height="420"></h4>

<h4 align="center">Figure 4: Imposed loads are
applied to the model at eight nodes.</h4>

<p>Correct loading information is absolutely
vital in producing reliable results. In this study, a major
effort was made to define a realistic and self-consistent set of
load conditions. We will describe the load cases at some length
since, in the bicycling industry at present, there is no accepted
"standard load set" for designers to work with. We
examined the following eight load cases as part of an
investigation of the frames' overall safety and performance
characteristics:</p>

<p>- Static Start-Up: A 150 pound rider is
applying maximum effort to accelerate from a standing stop. The
rider is "out of the saddle" and inertial effects are
significant. Aerodynamic, rolling, and gyroscopic forces are
assumed negligible. The bike is in vertical equilibrium with the
front wheel pointed straight. Using published measurements of
pedal loads and acceleration, the equations of static and dynamic
equilibrium are solved to find chain, pedal, and handlebar loads.
We find that loads generated in this case are very similar to
those encountered in hill climbing.</p>

<p>- Horizontal Impact: Samples of every
manufacturer's frame design must pass certain physical tests to
comply with standards set in 1976 by the Bureau of National
Affairs (BNA) and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The
BNA's "Requirements for Bicycles" manual calls for a
single compressive loading test. A load of 980 Newtons (220
pounds) is applied to the front dropouts horizontally, with the
rear dropouts constrained from any translational motion. The
effect might be similar to a low speed, head-on collision into a
wall or curb. To pass the test, there must be no "...
visible evidence of fracture or frame deformation that
significantly limits the steering angle over which the wheel can
be turned".</p>

<p>- Vertical Impact: Vertical impact loads
are represented by multiplying the rider's weight by a certain
"G factor". For this study, three G's are used to
simulate long term road vibration effects in the absence of
pedaling forces. As a matter of interest, an object dropped from
an infinitesimal height onto a rigid surface would exert a two G
impact load, assuming total energy transfer. </p>

<p>- Front Wheel Braking: It is assumed that
the front tire is skidding and thus front pitchover is imminent.
Therefore, all weight is concentrated on the front wheel. Inertia
loads caused by deceleration are included in the analysis. It is
assumed that the rider applies no pedal loads during braking, and
that all horizontal forces imparted by the rider are countered at
the handlebars.</p>

<p>- Rear Wheel Braking: Here it is assumed
that the rear tire is skidding. Forces and moments imparted to
the seat stays by friction reactions at the brake pads are taken
into account. All other assumptions are similar to those of the
front wheel braking case. There is some conjecture involved in
these braking cases, because empirical measured data is lacking
on some of the important variables.</p>

<p>- Steady State Pedaling: This presents the
most complex array of applied loads for any case under
investigation. A 160 pound cyclist, seated on a 24-pound bicycle,
is generating .54 horsepower (400 watts) at a cadence of 80 rpm.
The front sprocket has 53T, the rear has 17T. It is assumed that
forces due to leg dynamics may be neglected. Aerodynamic forces
are also ignored since, at 25 mph, these forces are less than 10
pounds. Pedal forces and moments about the three principal axes
are obtained from published test reports. This data allows a
partial separation of the rider's mass and damping effect from
the system's response. We treat the rider as an
"inertia-less" rigid body which still applies its
static weight. We then apply the equilibrium conditions at
discrete time intervals (i.e. quasi-statically), to find the
applied loads at seat, chain, dropouts, and handlebars. This
requires the solution of seven simultaneous equations, plus an
additional assumption that all horizontal pedal loads (parallel
with the ground) are countered at the seat. This assumption is
arguable (because the exact distribution of loads depends on the
rider's individual style), but it is not critical. In this study,
the quasi-static pedal-load analysis was applied to the
"worst case" situation: when the cranks are positioned
at the maximum loading angle, approximately parallel with the
ground. </p>

<p>- Klein Patent Tests: In Gary Klein's
recently-issued patent, two tests are defined as indicators of
infringement: a lateral bending test and a bottom-bracket torsion
test. These tests may have evaluation merit in their own right,
but manufacturers also want to avoid legal problems. Thus, it may
be important to know whether a proposed design violates patent
claims before investing in its full development. Using FEA, these
stiffness tests are simulated in advance. The tests call for
applying loads to key frame locations, measuring local
deflection, and then calculating an equivalent directional
stiffness value. More on this later. </p>

<h3>FEA Solution and Output Data</h3>

<p>Once the input data for the FE model has
been specified, the computer then solves a set of simultaneous
linear equations for node displacements and internal element
forces. The equations are similar to the well known single
degree-of-freedom "spring equation:"</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>f = kx </p>
    <p>, where:</p>
    <p>f = applied axial force<br>
    k = axial spring constant<br>
    x = axial deflection</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the general FE model, the quantities of
interest (loads, stiffnesses, and deflections) are represented in
matrices: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>[F]= [K][X] </p>
    <p>, where:</p>
    <p>[F] = vector of node forces and moments<br>
    [K] = element stiffness matrix<br>
    [X] = vector of node displacements (i.e. translations and
    rotations)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After solving for the unknown loads or
displacements (usually several hundred or thousand unknowns), the
internal stresses (torsion, axial loading, shear, and two-axis
bending) in all the elements are calculated. In addition, the
principal stress directions and strain energy values are found
throughout the frame. The result is a "sea of numbers"
which precisely describes the frame's state of stress under the
given load condition.</p>

<p>One simple way to present the results of
the analysis is to plot the frame geometry with the displacements
highly magnified. Figures 5 and 6 show several such
"deformed geometry" plots for the Trek 770 and Bador
frames under some of the loads mentioned earlier.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Strength and Performance</h3>

<p>How is all of this information used?
Essentially, it helps the designer to reach a good compromise in
the frame's performance and strength characteristics. It is
important to recognize the difference between strength and
performance. Strength is the ability to sustain loading without
failure. Performance means minimizing of weight and optimizing of
stiffness attributes. In other words, the cyclist feels
performance, but not strength. Only the lack of strength may be
felt (i.e., frame failure). Thus, strength is a design
constraint, As long as the frame is "strong enough",
other variables which influence performance may be optimized for
some desired purpose (track bike, mountain bike, etc.)</p>

<h3>Design for Safety: Strength and Stress
Criteria</h3>

<p>For safe design, the stress state in each
frame element must fall within the material's "acceptable
design strength" for all possible failure modes (static
failure, fatigue, etc.) at that element. The finite-element
analysis can easily calculate the element stresses for virtually
any specified load condition. (Figure 7 shows Von Mises stress,
also called "effective stress," in selected frame
elements for the start-up load case, which produced the highest
element stresses of the eight cases we analyzed.) Thus, the frame
designer can check his work against whatever safety criteria must
be met. These checks can be repeated at any time during the
design process--for example, whenever a change is made in frame
geometry or tubing dimensions--because the calculations are
readily handled by the finite-elements program. </p>

<h4 align="center"><img src="./Finite Element Structural Analysis  A New Tool for Bicycle Frame Design, by Leisha A. Peterson and Kelly J. Londry_files/fea7.gif" width="484" height="718"></h4>

<blockquote>
    <h4 align="center">Figure 7: Stresses
    (ksi) in Trek 770 (above) and Bador (below) frames under
    start-up (hill-climbing) load condition. Note that highest
    stresses occur in lower part of seat tube.</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>An important safety concern in bicycle
frame design is fatigue failure. When any material is subjected
to repeated cyclic loads, its design strength must be decreased
in certain prescribed ways, For steels, the design strength
decreases until, at about one million stress-reversal cycles, a
fatigue endurance limit is reached. The nominal strength does not
decrease further from this minimum value, even if additional
stress cycles occur. For steel alloys such as Reynolds 531, the
fatigue limit is approximately one-half the ultimate strength. </p>

<p>The aluminum alloys generally used in
bicycle frames have no fatigue limit; a progressively smaller
design strength must be used as the number of expected stress
cycles increases. This means that aluminum alloys have
considerably less fatigue strength than their ultimate tensile
strengths would suggest.</p>

<p>For instance, aluminum 7075-T6 (similar to
the True Temper T2 alloy used in the Trek 2900) has a fatigue
strength of only 24 ksi at 500 million load cycles (a commonly
used design life for bicycles), which is less than 1/3 of its
ultimate tensile strength (80 ksi).</p>

<p>For these reasons, it is important for the
designer to understand the loads that can occur during the entire
life of the frame, and to apply appropriate fatigue strength
criteria. For instance, fatigue strength values may need to be
reduced further still to accommodate localized stress
concentrations, inferior surface finishes, and combined loading
effects. Finite element analysis proves to be helpful in
investigating a design for potential fatigue problems, even
though factors beyond the FEA-calculated stresses are involved. A
complete treatment of the fatigue analysis, however, is beyond
the scope of this report.</p>

<h3>Design for Performance: Stiffness and
Weight Criteria</h3>

<p>Once the safety criteria are met, work on
optimizing frame performance begins. The challenge is to minimize
weight without compromising frame stiffness (subject to strength
and comfort requirements).</p>

<p>With the computer, it's quite easy to
"experiment" by changing tube diameters and wall
thicknesses in a trial-and-error fashion. A problem with this
approach is that changing any one tube changes the stresses and
deflections throughout the entire frame. (The reason is that the
frame is statically indeterminate to a high degree; the load
paths change as the structure is changed.) Thus, it's often
difficult to discover just exactly which tube(s) should be
changed in trying to progress toward the optimum. To deal with
this problem, we developed the following technique.</p>

<h3>The Energy Method of Frame Optimization</h3>

<p>One problem with plots of stresses or
deformations is that they provide limited insight into the
trade-offs between stiffness characteristics, internal load
distributions, and weight reduction. Fortunately, there is
another powerful evaluation method which reveals this elusive
information. It is based on the true intent of a stiff frame -
efficient energy transfer from the cyclist to the rear wheel.
This implies the use of a strain energy minimization design
policy.</p>

<p>The true intent of a stiff frame is to
transfer energy efficiently from the cyclist to the rear wheel.
This implies that the designer should minimize the amount of
energy that goes into flexing (straining) the frame. Some of this
strain energy might be recoverable (i.e., released in such a way
as to add power to the rear wheel). But we know of no
measurements that show how much is recovered. Thus, we assume
that the best policy is to minimize strain energy absorption in
the frame.</p>

<p>When a bicycle frame deflects under load
application, work is done on the frame, resulting in the frame's
storage of human energy. A simple example is a linear spring
compressed by an axial force. The stored energy is then equal to
one half the applied force times the displacement of its
application point, in the direction of deflection:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>E=1/2(f)(x) </p>
    <p>, where: </p>
    <p>f = applied force<br>
    x = displacement from rest position</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recalling that force and deflection are
related through stiffness (f = kx, from equations above), the
strain energy equation may be re-written to show the influence of
stiffness, k, on energy storage: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>E = 1/2kx<sup>2</sup><br>
    E = 1/2f<sup>2</sup>/k</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If two different springs are subjected to
equal forces, the stiffer spring will store less energy. This
same principle also applies in a complex structure like a bicycle
frame. For the frame, it is possible to calculate the strain
energy stored in each element by using the matrix analogues of
the energy equations immediately above. We have found that this
distribution of energy within the frame is a useful indicator of
its overall stiffness profile. We have also found that the
concept of minimizing a frame's total energy storage is a helpful
tool in designing for optimum performance. </p>

<p>Thus, the FEA method complements empirical
load-deflection tests, such as the Klein patent test, which serve
well for an overall evaluation of existing frames, but do not
provide sufficient detailed data to show which frame components
may need to be changed to improve frame performance.</p>

<h3>Directional Stiffness</h3>

<p>We offer the following observations
relating energy principles to frame design:</p>

<p>1) "Frame stiffness" cannot be
specified by a single number in the same way that, for example,
weight can. Rather, one frame has "many stiffnesses," a
consequence of the matrix ( [k] ) representation in the
finite-element model. In other words, frame stiffness is a
directional quantity, and thus it is preferable to speak of
"directional stiffness" and to specify the directions
of applied force and displacement when using the term.</p>

<p>2) Strain energy, however, is scalar
(non-directional), and therefore may be expressed by a single,
absolute number. This provides a convenient figure-of-merit by
which alternative frame designs may be compared. Further, the
amount of strain energy absorbed by each element may be expressed
as a percentage of the total, allowing each member's own
significance to be understood. In short, energy distribution
reflects, in a non-directional manner, the influence of
directional stiffness characteristics.</p>

<p>3) A good frame design does not attempt to
maximize stiffness in every direction. Rather, a good design
tailors the interrelations between stiffness, internal load
paths, and loading range, while aiming to achieve the lowest
possible energy storage for a given weight. </p>

<h3>Trek 770</h3>

<p>A close look at the Trek 770 will clarify
these points. Figure 8 shows the strain energy pattern within
each tube of the Trek 770, for four loading cases. </p>

    <h4 align="center">Figure 8: Strain Energy

</blockquote>

<p>First, note that the start-up (or
hill-climbing) load generates the highest level of energy
storage. The energy stored here (79.5 in-lb) represents about 4.0
percent of the rider's total energy output under typical
hill-climbing conditions. This might sound like a small
percentage, but in racing situations, even a slight reduction in
this percentage would be noticed.</p>

<p>Consider now the significance of the other
load cases. The cruising condition has much lower energy losses
than the hill-climb case: 3.26 in-lb versus 79.5 in-lb. In the 3G
vertical impact case, the strain energy is a mere 1.42 in-lbs. We
draw the conclusion that, for the sake of rider comfort, energy
losses in the vertical direction could be increased with little
negative effect on climbing performance. In other words, the new
2000 frame design could aim for greater vertical in-plane
flexibility than the 770 had.</p>

<p>The patterns in which the total energy is
distributed among each frame tube are also interesting. For
example, the seatstays absorb most of the vertical impact loads,
but they do not play a major role in the other cases. Since
vertical impact is not a significant factor in overall
performance, the seatstays thus become prime candidates for
shedding excess material (subject to strength constraints).</p>

<p>Another observation pertains to the three
main tubes. For the cruising condition, energy losses are well
balanced among them. But the down tube consumes almost 50% of the
total strain energy in the start-up condition. This could be
attributed to the out-of-saddle riding position that we assumed
for this case. Thus, these numbers support the idea of designing
different frames to suit different riders' styles (for example,
those who sit versus those who stand for hill climbing, or those
who "hammer" versus those who "spin" on the
straightaway).</p>

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>We are now in a position to review all
three frame designs. In Figure 9, the strain energy absorbed by
each tube in the Trek 770, Trek 2000, and Bador frames is
plotted, for the start-up load case. </p>

    start-up (hill-climbing) load case.</h4>
</blockquote>

<p>This graph clearly shows the contribution
each tube makes to the frames' overall performance. </p>

<p>This data is further broken down in Figure
10, which lists the percentage of strain energy accounted for by
each of the four modes of deformation (axial loading, bending out
of the plane of the frame, in-plane bending, and torsion). </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some important observations are:</p>

<p>- The down tube is always the greatest
energy absorber. It stores between 38% and 49% of the total. Of
this, between 58% and 66% is due to torsion. The remainder is due
to out-of-plane bending. In-plane bending and axial loading are
insignificant.</p>

<p>- The seat tube is the second highest
energy absorber. It stores between 19% and 25% percent of the
total. Most of this (between 79% and 84%) is due to out-of-plane
bending, while 15% to 20% is due to torsion. Again, in-plane
bending and axial loading are insignificant.</p>

<p>- The top tube stores between 10% and 13%
of the total energy. Between 49% and 58% of this is due to
out-of-plane bending. The remainder is due to torsion. In-plane
bending and axial loading are insignificant.</p>

<p>- The two chainstays together account for
9% to 13% percent of the total energy. Out-of-plane bending
accounts for 22% to 38% of this, while in-plane bending is
between 12% and 21%. Note that these bending trends oppose the
traditional use of elliptical chainstays with the major axis in
the vertical direction. Torsion accounts for 28% to 62% of the
energy storage. The apparent wide range of percentages here stems
from the different loads encountered on the left and right sides.
Perhaps asymmetrical chainstays should be used.</p>

<p>- Considering that in-plane bending is so
insignificant in this important load case, the structural
inefficiency of aerodynamic tubing becomes apparent. (Aero tubing
has greater in-plane bending stiffness than out-of-plane.)</p>

<p>- Considering the high percentage of
out-of-plane bending losses in the seat tube, it would make sense
structurally to redesign this tube. One possibility is to use an
out-of-plane elliptical cross-section, but this poses aerodynamic
questions. Another possibility is for manufacturers to produce
round-OD tubes with internal reinforcing ribs running the length
of the tube, something like the butted sections of Columbus SLX
and SPX tubing.</p>

<p>The final conclusions are given in the plot
of weight versus strain energy in Figure 11 (data is from Figure
9). The Trek 2000 is clearly the stiffest frame of the three,
since it is lowest in strain energy absorption. In addition, it
is lighter than the Trek 770 and almost as light as the Bador.
The Bador is the most flexible frame, since it is highest in
strain energy storage.</p>

<p>The conclusions of this study are all in
good agreement with rider perceptions, and perhaps offer few
surprises to the experienced frame designer. What, then, is the
value of the FEA method? Speed, for one thing. Physical testing
at the level of detail described here would take many times
longer than the computer calculations. More important, the
groundwork is now laid for future explorations with new
materials. In particular, frame design with fiber composites,
with their highly directional properties, should be much simpler
with the FEA method than by trial and error.</p>
